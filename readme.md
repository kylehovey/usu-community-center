# USU Community Center

## Abstract:

This is a proposal to utilize the space once occupied by the Artist's Block cafe as a community center focused on free services for students and supported by donations and volunteers. The purpose of this document is to outline ideas on how such an arrangement could provide great value and benefit to the Caine College of the Arts (CCA) community and to the community of the Logan campus at large. This proposal is tentative, and it serves primarily as a vision of what that space could become. 

## Motivation:

This proposal is largely inspired by the [Front Porch](https://www.frontporchslo.org/), a student coffee house and study space at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obisbo. At the Front Porch, coffee and tea are free of charge to everyone, and the endeavor is simply supported through volunteers and donations. An amazing community flourishes within its walls, and we of this proposal have been putting a great amount of thought into how to create a similar community here on the Logan campus. 

## Goals:
* Create an inclusive and welcoming environment
* Provide a free-use community kitchen maintained by volunteers
* Provide free coffee, tea, and water
* Provide ample seating and tables for homework and social congregation

## Business Model
A model of volunteers and donations means that the community center would, unlike the Artist's Block, not need to rely on turning a profit to remain in operation. We are currently in communication with the owner of the Front Porch to make detailed note of their operational procedures.

Additionaly, USU already has a great [volunteer outreach program](https://orgsync.com/login/utah-state-university) that could help incentivise students by giving them an opportunity to add volunteer experience to their resume.

## Conclusion
With the closing of the Artist's Block, the loss of an important social space has been felt deeply by the community of the CCA. With the space's familiarity, easy and open location in the art building, and former life as a cafe, the shell of the Artist's Block serves as an ideal location for a community center---and perhaps even as a satisfying rebirth of a gathering place that once was.
